# HxCTiC
 - Changes to base TiCon mechanics
	- Hardness from ore ~= Material hardness
	- Mining level from ore ~= mining level
	- Color from ingot detection for material color
	- Molten metal color RGB if possible? Or just closest material color/red
	- Drawspeed for bow based on hardness
	- Material Traits configurable + have default file hosted on github? 
 - Bowstring Materials
	- Rubber (OreDict'd)
	- Sinew (20% chance to drop from sheep)
	- Hemp (IE or custom, stamping)
	- Parachord (nylon poured over raw hemp string)
	- Nylon 6,6 (synthetic material HxCTech) (Untill tech mod is finished use spider string in smeltery)
	- Linen (stamp reeds)
	- Leather (stamping table)
	- Kevlar? (synthetic material HxCTech)
	- Woven carbon fiber string (IC2)
 - New alloying 
       - Fayalite - extremely sharp material with low durablity - made by melting iron and nether quartz in a 2:1 ratio (jagged mod)
       - Spinel - durable material with a moderatly good mining level - made from epsom salt (bucket of water in furnace), aluminium and water heated to a high temp (stonebound mod)
